## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues on Windows

If you experience issues with the environment variables not being recognized on Windows:

1. Set the environment variable in your terminal session:

   ```powershell
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

2. Restart the development server:
   ```powershell
   pnpm expo start --clear
   ```

### GitHub Security Warnings

If you receive GitHub security warnings about API keys in your code:

1. Ensure you're not committing your `.env` file (it should be in `.gitignore`)
2. Double-check that no API keys are hardcoded in your source files
3. Use the `.env.example` file as a template without real keys
