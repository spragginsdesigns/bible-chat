## Solution Framework

This section details the steps to integrate and use the `o3-mini` model with TypeScript using the AI SDK.

### 1. Installation

Install the necessary packages using your preferred package manager (npm example shown, adapt for pnpm if needed):

```bash
npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai
# or
# pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/openai
```

Ensure you have version `1.1.9` or greater of `@ai-sdk/openai`.

### 2. Basic Configuration and Usage

Import the required functions and initialize the model:

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set

async function getO3MiniResponse(promptContent: string) {
	try {
		const { text } = await generateText({
			model: openai("o3-mini"), // Specify the o3-mini model
			prompt: promptContent
		});
		console.log("Model Response:", text);
		return text;
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error generating text:", error);
		// Handle error appropriately
	}
}

// Example usage
getO3MiniResponse("Explain the concept of quantum entanglement.");
```

### 3. Adjusting Reasoning Effort

The `o3-mini` model allows tuning the reasoning effort to balance speed and response quality using the `reasoningEffort` provider option:

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

async function getLowEffortResponse(promptContent: string) {
	try {
		const { text } = await generateText({
			model: openai("o3-mini"),
			prompt: promptContent,
			providerOptions: {
				openai: {
					reasoningEffort: "low" // Options: 'low', 'medium', 'high' (default is likely medium)
				}
			}
		});
		console.log("Low Effort Response:", text);
		return text;
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error generating low effort text:", error);
	}
}

getLowEffortResponse("Explain quantum entanglement briefly.");
```

### 4. Developer Features

The AI SDK and `o3-mini` support advanced features:

- **Function Calling / Tool Calling:** Allows the model to request calls to external functions or tools you define. (Refer to AI SDK documentation for implementation details).
- **Structured Outputs:** Enables the model to return data in a specific JSON schema. (Refer to AI SDK documentation for implementation details).
- **System/Developer Messages:** The SDK can automatically convert system messages to developer messages for structured reasoning tasks.

```typescript
// Example demonstrating potential for structured output (implementation details in SDK docs)
async function getStructuredOutputExample() {
	try {
		// Hypothetical usage - actual implementation depends on SDK's structured output features
		const { text } = await generateText({
			// Or a dedicated function like 'generateStructuredText' if available
			model: openai("o3-mini"),
			prompt:
				"Generate a JSON object for a user profile with name, email, and age fields.",
			// Additional parameters for structured output schema would be needed here
			providerOptions: {
				openai: {
					reasoningEffort: "medium"
				}
			}
		});
		console.log("Structured Output Example:", text);
		// Potentially parse 'text' if it's a JSON string
	} catch (error) {
		console.error("Error generating structured output:", error);
	}
}

getStructuredOutputExample();
```

### 5. Prompting Best Practices

- **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use simple, direct instructions.
- **Avoid Explicit Chain-of-Thought:** The model handles internal reasoning; prompts like "think step-by-step" are generally unnecessary.
- **Use Delimiters:** Clearly separate different parts of your prompt (e.g., instructions vs. context) using tags (`<context>`, `</context>`) or quotation marks.

---

## Risk Assessment

- Not applicable for this documentation task. Risks would be associated with the specific implementation within an application (e.g., API key security, cost management, handling model errors), not the documentation itself.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Detailed Narrative

Integrating OpenAI's `o3-mini` model into TypeScript applications is effectively achieved using the Vercel AI SDK. This SDK provides helper functions (`generateText`, etc.) and model definitions (`openai('o3-mini')`) that abstract away much of the direct API interaction complexity. Key steps involve installing the `ai` and `@ai-sdk/openai` packages, importing necessary functions, and configuring the `generateText` call with the `o3-mini` model identifier. The SDK supports adjusting the model's `reasoningEffort` and enables advanced features like tool calling and structured outputs, although detailed implementation requires consulting the official AI SDK documentation. Adhering to prompting best practices, such as clarity and using delimiters, will improve results.

### Concise Key Takeaways

- **Use the AI SDK:** Install `ai` and `@ai-sdk/openai` (v1.1.9+).
- **Instantiate Model:** Use `openai('o3-mini')` within SDK functions like `generateText`.
- **API Key:** Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is configured.
- **Reasoning Effort:** Optionally adjust `reasoningEffort` (`low`, `medium`, `high`) via `providerOptions`.
- **Advanced Features:** Explore tool calling and structured outputs via AI SDK documentation.
- **Prompting:** Be clear, concise, and use delimiters; avoid explicit chain-of-thought instructions.
- **Consult Docs:** Refer to the official Vercel AI SDK documentation for comprehensive details and updates.
